# music-player-pro


Music Player Pro is a simple music player android application designed by me which takes permissions from the user to read audio files and then shows the user all the audio files in his/her device which can be played in a list-view format.
A user can play a song of his/her choice by clicking on the song name displayed in the list-view and then the music player will be launched playing the music. 
The music player has all the basic functionalities like play, pause, next, previous, fast-forward and fast-backward. 
Some animations are also added when the above buttons are clicked to improve the visual appeal of the music player.
