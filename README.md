# music-player-pro


Music Player Pro is a simple music player android application designed by me which takes permissions from the user to read audio files and then shows the user all the audio files in his/her device which can be played in a list-view format.
A user can play a song of his/her choice by clicking on the song name displayed in the list-view and then the music player will be launched playing the music. 
The music player has all the basic functionalities like play, pause, next, previous, fast-forward and fast-backward. 
Some animations are also added when the above buttons are clicked to improve the visual appeal of the music player.


Some Screenshots of the application running on my device (Android 11)
